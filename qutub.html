                <li style="color: orangered; font-size: 25px;">Who built Qutub Minar and why?</li>
                <li style="color: blue; list-style-type:  square; font-size: 20px;;">Qutbu'd-Din Aibak laid the foundation of Minar in AD 1199 for the use of the
                    mu'azzin (crier) to give calls for prayer and raised the first storey, to which were added three
                    more storeys by his successor and son-in-law, Shamsu'd-Din Iltutmish (AD 1211-36).</li><br>
                <li style="color: orangered; font-size: 25px;">Did Qutub Minar have 7 floors?</li>
                <li style="color: blue; list-style-type:  square; font-size: 20px;;">The Qutb Minar consists of five stories of red and grey sandstone. The lowest
                    story, also known as the basement story, was completed during the lifetime of Ghiyath al-Din
                    Muhammad, a sultan of the Ghurid dynasty.</li><br>
                <li style="color: orangered; font-size: 25px;">What is the story of Qutub Minar?</li>
                <li style="color: blue; list-style-type:  square; font-size: 20px;;">The Qutub Minar, also spelled "Qutb Minar," was built in 1192 by Qutb-ud-din
                    Aibak, the first Sultan and first Muslim ruler of Delhi, and was completed in 1368 by Firoz Shah
                    Tughlaq. The history of building royal tombs dates back to the 13th century.</li><br>
                <li style="color: orangered; font-size: 25px;">What is Qutub Minar famous for?</li>
                <li style="color: blue; list-style-type:  square; font-size: 20px;;">
                    Built of red and buff sandstone and eloquently carved with inscriptional bands, the Qutb Minar is
                    the tallest masonry tower in India, measuring 72.5 metres high, with projecting balconies for
                    calling all Muadhdhin to prayer. </li><br>
                <li style="color: orangered; font-size: 25px;">Why was Qutub Minar destroyed?</li>
                <li style="color: blue; list-style-type: square; font-size: 20px;">Records in History state that in the year 1505, Qutab Minar was damaged by an
                    earthquake and lighting. It was repaired by one of the rulers of the Lodhi Dynasty.</li><br>
