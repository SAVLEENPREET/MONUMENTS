        <li>The Victoria Memorial is a large
            marble monument dedicated to Queen Victoria, the Empress of India (1876-1901) facing the Queens Way on the
            Maidan in Central Kolkata. It was built between 1906 and 1921 by the British Raj.</li>
        <li>
            It was built between 1906 and 1921 by
            the British Raj. It is the largest monument to a monarch anywhere in the
            world.</li>
        <li>
            It is the largest monument to a monarch anywhere in the world. It stands at 64 acres of gardens and is now a
            museum under the control of the Ministry of Culture, Government of India.</li>
        <li> Possessing prominent features of
            the Indo-Saracenic architecture, it has evolved into one of the most popular attractions in the city.</li>
            <li>The Victoria Memorial would come to stand in what would be a major provincial capital, rather than the national capital. The Victoria Memorial was completed and formally opened to the public in December 1921 by the Prince of Wales, the future Edward VIII.</li>

        <li> It stands at 64 acres of gardens and is now a

            the Indo-Saracenic architecture, it has evolved into one of the most popular attractions in the city.</li>
        <li> The government officials, princes, politicians, and people of India responded generously to Lord Curzon's
            appeal for funds, and the total cost of construction of the monument.</li>
      <li> The site chosen was near the present-day Raj Bhavan, known at the time as Government House. The construction of
        the Victoria Memorial was delayed by Curzon's departure from India in 1905, with a subsequent loss of local
        enthusiasm for the project.</li>
        <li>There was also some uncertainty about the strength of the foundations, and tests on
        them were carried out.[7] On 4 January 1906, George, the Prince of Wales laid the foundation stone.</li>
